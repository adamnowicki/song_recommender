A list of matching songs will be displayed. Choose the song that best matches your preference.
### Get Recommendations:
Once you select a song, Parkies will analyze its audio features to understand your taste.
Based on the selected song's features, Parkies will recommend two similar tracks for you to explore.
Simply sit back and enjoy your personalized recommendations!

## How It Works

### Audio Feature Analysis:
Parkie analyzes key audio features of the selected song, such as danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, and valence.
### Recommendation Algorithm:
Using machine learning models trained on Spotify's vast music database, Parkie identifies clusters of songs with similar audio features.
It then recommends two tracks from the cluster that closely match your selected song's characteristics.

## Note

Parkies Recommendations is powered by Spotify's API and utilizes machine learning models to provide personalized suggestions.
For the best experience, ensure you have an active internet connection.
Sit back, relax, and let Parkies guide you through a world of music tailored just for you!
